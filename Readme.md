# Learning Odin with Advent of Code 2024

This repository is part of my ongoing effort to learn new programming languages. For this repo, I’m focusing on **Nim**.

I’ll be working through **Advent of Code 2024** challenges to get hands-on practice, since I’ve never gone through AoC before and it’s a great way to learn a language in a practical way.

**Advent of Code 2024:**

I’ll post occasional updates, progress, and notes here:

## Goals

* Learn the Nim language from scratch
* Build real solutions instead of toy examples
* Compare Nim’s ergonomics and performance to C++ (Personal Goal)
* Finish as many AoC 2024 problems as time allows

## Structure

Each day will live in src with days as in day1, day2, etc etc...


With solutions written in Nim and any notes or benchmarks included as needed.
